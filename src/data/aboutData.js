    description2: "I build complete AI systems with a strong focus on Large Language Models. My work covers building retrieval augmented generation pipelines, applying alignment techniques, and deploying solutions to the cloud using Docker, Kubernetes, and serverless setups.\n\nI often create custom tuned smaller LLMs, usually eight billion parameters or below, built for specific tasks that solve real problems in different industries. These include automating compliance checks in banking, matching candidates to jobs in recruitment, and improving internal processes with intelligent automation.\n\nI also develop multi agent systems with tool calling and orchestration, supported by MCP servers to connect multiple tools and services. I add guardrails and validation pipelines so these systems stay reliable in production.\n\nIf you're building LLM systems that must work in the real world, I can help.",
