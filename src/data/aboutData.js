    description1: "My name's Sameed. I'm a passionate AI Engineer ðŸ¤– experienced in AI Agents, RAG, fine-tuning, and deploying scalable AI pipelines.",
    description2: "I design and scale end-to-end AI systems which go from model training and tool-calling workflows to MCP servers, APIs, and cloud deployments. My focus is on grounded knowledge, guardrails, and validation, while also enjoying building smaller agents and automations for everyday use. Outside of work, I tinker with side projects and sometimes wind down with CS2, RDR2, or Battlefield.",
